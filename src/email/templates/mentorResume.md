Hi {{ mentor.givenName }},

Thank you for your help with {{ event.name }}. I know many mentors are looking for new jobs, and wanted to offer a small bit of help.

If you are currently looking for a job or are open to opportunities, please reply to this email with:

- Your resume
- What role you are looking for
- Interested company sizes (small startups / mid-large startups / well-established large companies)
- Preferences on location (remote only? where you live? places you are open to relocating?)
- Any verticals you have experience with

I am somewhat well connected in the startup industry from my history as a Y Combinator alum, and CodeDay is generally
well connected with tech hiring outside of household-name tech companies. I am happy to find some companies in my
network which are a good fit and pass on your resume.

(If you are thinking of starting a startup, let me know that too! I can recommend folks internally to Y Combinator and
to investors from my former startup.)

This is an automated email but I will personally read your response if you reply.

Tyler Menezes
