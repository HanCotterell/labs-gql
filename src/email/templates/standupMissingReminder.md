Hi {{ to.name }},

It looks like you did not complete the Slack standup that was due {{ prettyDate standup.dueAt }}.

Standups are required for all participants. This isn't just a formality or a grade: standups are a popular way for teams to keep each other updated on the status of their work.

**How do I submit a standup?**  
Standups are submitted asynchronously in your team's Slack channel. The Standup and Prosper bot will prompt you when it's time to respond to the next standup, and you need to submit your responses through that bot.

**I can't submit a standup until I talk to my teammates!**  
Your standup **is** a way to talk to your teammates. Standups are not a progress report to your manager (or professor), they are meant to help you and your teammates stay in sync!

**How much do I need to write in my standup?**  
1-3 sentences for each question. Please try to be _specific_ (e.g. "Tried to debug a problem with X but still having problem Y" rather than "Fix the code") but you don't need to write tons of detail.

**I submitted a standup, but it didn't count.**  
Please make sure you submitted your standup to the Standup and Prosper bot. Posting directly in the channel or replying in a thread is NOT counted. You can also try [re-linking your Slack account in the dashboard]({{ dashboardFor to }}).

If you have additional questions, please reply to this email.
