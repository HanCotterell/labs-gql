Hi {{ student.givenName }},

Congratulations on your contribution to open-source in {{ event.name }}, and thank you (or your teammate) for providing the URL of your PR for verification!

As a celebration of your contribution to the open-source ecosystem, we'd like to send you a physical "Open Source Contributor" lapel pin.

[Order your pin here,](https://shop.codeday.org/products/open-source-software-contributor-lapel-pin) and enter the following discount code at checkout: **YS141YY0R2HP** (If you already have an open-source contributor pin, you can use the same code to get any other $10 item for free.)

To help you stay healthy in your career, we have also partnered with Kinesis to offer you a significant discount on an ergonomic
keyboard. If you're interested, just respond to this email with which keyboard you want, and we will request a discount code
for you from Kinesis. (We don't receive any compensation from Kinesis, we just think ergonomics are important.)
